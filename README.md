Learning to Translate in Real-time with Neural Machine Translation
===================================

This code is the Theano implementation of the EACL2017 paper [Learning to Translate in Real-time with Neural Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.00388). It is based on the dl4mt tutorial (https://github.com/nyu-dl/dl4mt-tutorial).

Dependencies:
----------------------
### Python 2.7
* Theano 0.8 (cuda 8.0, cudnn v5)
* seaborn, pandas (for drawing the heatmap)
* NLTK 3.2.1

### Preprocessing
The preprocessing and evaluation scripts are from [MOSES](https://github.com/moses-smt/mosesdecoder).
